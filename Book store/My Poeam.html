<h1>
 The March of the Earth
</h1>
<body bgimg="113.jfif" >
Earth, you’re nestled in twilight and <br>
from your slumber flows of lava <br> erupted awake in fury
to the drumbeat of a stately march<br>
oozing over the slothful time of budding shoots<br>
and bones saturated in humus-rich soil<br>

follow the rhythm of your vapors and dance with me,<br> Earth
let us lose ourselves<br>
let us lose ourselves<br>
in a delirium<br>

I saved some of your jasmine fragrance, Earth<br>
smear it onto my breasts<br>
and make love to me<br>
till you’ve pulled my hair straight into your heart<br>

I feed your spawn<br>
I, time of eternity<br>
give birth to the new world<br>
</body>
